# Search â€“ CS50W Project 0

This project is a basic frontend clone of the Google search interface, developed as Project 0 for Harvard's CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to recreate a simplified version of Googleâ€™s:

- Main search page
- Image search page
- Advanced search page

The project focuses solely on the frontend using **HTML and CSS**. No JavaScript or backend functionality is included.

## Features

- Simple and clean interface inspired by Googleâ€™s layout  
- Working form actions that direct to real Google search endpoints  
- Dedicated pages for image and advanced search  
- Responsive design using CSS and SCSS for modular styling

## Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3  

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file  
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser  
3. Use the navigation links or buttons to explore the other pages (`images.html`, `advanced.html`)

## Requirements Met

- The site includes three pages: Search, Image Search, and Advanced Search  
- All forms submit data to Googleâ€™s actual search endpoints  
- All styling is done with custom CSS, using Sass for better organization

## Summary

This project demonstrates fundamental frontend skills, including layout design, form handling, and modular styling using Sass.  
It serves as a foundation for more complex web development projects in the CS50W course.
